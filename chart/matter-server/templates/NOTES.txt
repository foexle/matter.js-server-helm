Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

Your Matter Server is being deployed with the following configuration:

{{- if .Values.hostNetwork }}
  Host Network: ENABLED (required for Matter mDNS/multicast)
{{- end }}

To connect to the Matter Server:

{{- if .Values.hostNetwork }}
  1. Find the node IP where the pod is running:
     kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "matter-server.name" . }}" -o wide

  2. Connect via WebSocket:
     ws://<NODE_IP>:{{ .Values.matterServer.port }}/ws
{{- end }}

For Home Assistant integration:
  - Add the Matter integration
  - Use the WebSocket URL above as the server address

IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - Matter requires IPv6 to be enabled on your cluster nodes
  - For Thread support, ensure you have a Thread Border Router
